        debian packaged perlcritic 1.126, if an element contains blank lines then
        the source %r displayed for a violation is wrong.  For example perlcritic

        String *may* require interpolation at line 3, near ''''.  (Severity: 1)\r\n\r\nwhereas
        I hoped it would be \"near ''@bar''\".\r\n\r\nSome inputs provoke an unitialized
